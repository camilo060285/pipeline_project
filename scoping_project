## üó∫Ô∏è Project Scoping

Properly scoping the project provides structure and clarity while identifying key steps in the machine learning lifecycle. The scope will evolve as we learn more during implementation.

### üéØ Goals

- **Primary Goal**: Build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline capable of making accurate predictions and supporting data-driven decision-making.
- **Secondary Goals**:
  - Practice reproducible ML practices using production-ready code.
  - Demonstrate understanding of the full ML workflow from raw data to deployment.
  - Produce a polished portfolio project that can be shared with potential employers or clients.

### üì¶ Data

> *(Update once dataset is chosen)*

- **Source**: [To be determined / Insert dataset link]
- **Description**: [Brief explanation of the dataset ‚Äì e.g., structure, sample size, time range]
- **Target Variable**: [What you're trying to predict ‚Äì e.g., price, churn, disease]
- **Features**: [List key features and their types ‚Äì categorical, numerical, etc.]
- **Expected Challenges**:
  - Missing or noisy data
  - Class imbalance (if classification)
  - Feature correlation or dimensionality

### üìä Analysis Plan

#### Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Understand distributions and relationships between variables.
- Identify and handle missing values, outliers, or anomalies.
- Visualize key insights.

#### Step 2: Data Preprocessing
- Encode categorical variables
- Normalize or scale features
- Create new engineered features
- Split into train/test sets

#### Step 3: Modeling
- Baseline model with simple algorithms (e.g., logistic regression)
- Compare multiple models (e.g., random forest, XGBoost)
- Hyperparameter tuning via cross-validation

#### Step 4: Evaluation
- Use metrics appropriate to the task (e.g., accuracy, ROC-AUC, RMSE)
- Analyze error cases
- Address overfitting/underfitting

#### Step 5: Pipeline Productionalization
- Modularize code into reusable scripts
- Integrate config management
- Save model artifacts and track experiments
- Containerize with Docker (optional)

#### Step 6: Documentation & Reporting
- Create clear README, code comments, and Jupyter Notebooks
- Include test coverage and CI/CD pipeline (optional)
