## üó∫Ô∏è Project Scoping

Properly scoping the project provides structure and clarity while identifying key steps in the machine learning lifecycle. The scope will evolve as we learn more during implementation.

### üéØ Goals

- **Primary Goal**: Build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline capable of making accurate predictions and supporting data-driven decision-making.
- **Secondary Goals**:
  - Practice reproducible ML practices using production-ready code.
  - Demonstrate understanding of the full ML workflow from raw data to deployment.
  - Produce a polished portfolio project that can be shared with potential employers or clients.

### üì¶ Data

- **Source**: [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset ‚Äì Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)
- **Description**:  
  This dataset contains information about 1,470 employees at a fictional IBM workplace. It includes demographic, job-related, and satisfaction-related variables, designed to help predict whether an employee is likely to voluntarily leave the company (attrition). The data is clean and well-suited for supervised machine learning tasks, particularly binary classification.
- **Target Variable**:  
  `Attrition` ‚Äì Indicates whether an employee left the company (`Yes`) or stayed (`No`).
- **Features**:
  - **Categorical**:
    - `BusinessTravel`, `Department`, `EducationField`, `Gender`, `JobRole`, `MaritalStatus`, `OverTime`
  - **Ordinal**:
    - `Education`, `EnvironmentSatisfaction`, `JobInvolvement`, `JobSatisfaction`, `PerformanceRating`, `RelationshipSatisfaction`, `WorkLifeBalance`
  - **Numerical**:
    - `Age`, `DailyRate`, `DistanceFromHome`, `HourlyRate`, `MonthlyIncome`, `MonthlyRate`, `NumCompaniesWorked`, `PercentSalaryHike`, `TotalWorkingYears`, `TrainingTimesLastYear`, `YearsAtCompany`, `YearsInCurrentRole`, `YearsSinceLastPromotion`, `YearsWithCurrManager`
- **Expected Challenges**:
  - **Class imbalance**: Only ~16% of employees left, making "Yes" the minority class.
  - **Feature correlation**: Some numerical fields like income and years of experience may be collinear.
  - **Overfitting risk**: The relatively small sample size (1,470 rows) requires careful regularization and validation.

### üìä Analysis Plan

#### Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Understand distributions and relationships between variables.
- Identify and handle missing values, outliers, or anomalies.
- Visualize key insights.

#### Step 2: Data Preprocessing
- Encode categorical variables
- Normalize or scale features
- Create new engineered features
- Split into train/test sets

#### Step 3: Modeling
- Baseline model with simple algorithms (e.g., logistic regression)
- Compare multiple models (e.g., random forest, XGBoost)
- Hyperparameter tuning via cross-validation

#### Step 4: Evaluation
- Use metrics appropriate to the task (e.g., accuracy, ROC-AUC, RMSE)
- Analyze error cases
- Address overfitting/underfitting

#### Step 5: Pipeline Productionalization
- Modularize code into reusable scripts
- Integrate config management
- Save model artifacts and track experiments
- Containerize with Docker (optional)

#### Step 6: Documentation & Reporting
- Create clear README, code comments, and Jupyter Notebooks
- Include test coverage and CI/CD pipeline (optional)
