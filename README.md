# 🧠 End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline Project

## 🚀 Overview

This portfolio project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow designed to enable predictive analysis and data-driven decision-making. The workflow is transformed into a production-ready pipeline to showcase best practices in building scalable, maintainable, and reproducible ML systems.

## 🎯 Objective

- Build a complete ML pipeline from data ingestion to deployment.
- Enable accurate predictions on a real-world dataset.
- Implement reproducible workflows using best engineering practices.
- Package the pipeline for production-level execution.

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Data Ingestion** – Load and validate raw data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualize, clean, and understand patterns.
3. **Feature Engineering** – Select, create, or transform relevant features.
4. **Model Training** – Train multiple models and perform hyperparameter tuning.
5. **Evaluation** – Assess model performance using appropriate metrics.
6. **Packaging** – Modularize the pipeline using scripts and/or frameworks.
7. **Testing** – Ensure robustness with unit and integration tests.
8. **Deployment** – Prepare model for deployment (batch, API, etc.).
9. **Monitoring (optional)** – Add hooks for performance tracking and model drift.
